# Numerical Solution to Kepler's Equation üõ∞Ô∏è

This Python notebook calculates the **position** and **velocity** of a satellite orbiting Earth, `t` hours after passing its periapsis, using Kepler's laws and orbital mechanics equations.

## **What It Does**
1. **Inputs**:  
   - Time since Periapsis (seconds)
     
2. **Results**:
   - Distance from Earth (kms)
   - Velocity (km/s)
   - True Anomaly (rad)
  
## Skills Involved
1. Orbital Mechanics (specifically, orbital elements)
2. Kepler's Equation of Anomalies (mean and eccentric anomolies involved)
3. Newton Raphson Method to solve the Kepler's Equation
   
## **How to Use**
* Change the value of `Time since periapsis (seconds)` and run all the cells of the notebook.
* Current state of the notebook shows the output for the distance and velocity of the satellite 4 hours since the periapsis.
